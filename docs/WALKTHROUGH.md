# Walkthrough

This is quick site walkthrough for testing functionality:

- Visit https://warm-hamlet-22515.herokuapp.com/
- At the Home Page, visit About Page.
- Visit Contact Page.
- Visit the Error Page by appending "/error" to the URL. You should see no trace stack.  Click on the "Return to Home Page" button.
- Attempt to visit a non-existent page by appending "/lost" to the URL. You should be redirected to the Login page.
- Attempt to visit Admin Pages.
- At the Login page, click "Cancel" in the warning. You should be redirected to UMGC.
- Click the back button and click on the Login link.
- Acknowledge the warning by clicking "OK", then click on the Log in button. It should not let you log in.
- Attempt to enter nonsense text or fake credentials. You should receive warnings and errors.

- Enter "<script>" (without the quotes) in the Last Name textbox, "P@ssW0rd" in the Password textbox, and "I don't know" in the Security Question text box. Click on "Register". You should receive warnings and errors.
- Enter a set of credentials. DO NOT SELECT ANY ALLERGIES, CONDITIONS, OR MEDICATIONS. I have a known bug where the page returns strings in set format which need to be converted into actual set types.
